# BigBMeetup Website, Branding, and Business Strategy Document

### 1. Overview

**BigBMeetup** is more than an initiative — it's a **movement**. Founded in April 2018 by **Bosco Menezes** in Qatar under the vision of **BigB Fotografi**, BigBMeetup has spent over seven years bringing people and organizations together through inclusive, creative, and socially meaningful programs. It unites schools, museums, corporates, and local communities around shared values and real impact.

Its five key pillars form the foundation of this community movement:

* **Sports & Wellness**

* **Celebrating Art & Culture**

* **Estedama (Sustainability)**

* **This Ability** – Championing people who are differently-abled and neurodiverse

* **Animal Welfare**

Since its inception, BigBMeetup has successfully hosted **13 major editions** — each themed around one of these pillars and held at iconic venues such as **The Torch, Aspire Zone**, **Fraser Suites**, **Sheikh Faisal Bin Qasim Al Thani Museum**, and **Qatar Foundation's Multaqa**. These events have highlighted wellness, art, inclusion, sustainability, and social impact through inspiring storytelling, photography, and community engagement.
